## Briefly About Me

My name is Krai Naruepornmatee. I graduated with first-class honors in Mechanical Engineering from the [Department of Mechanical Engineering], [Faculty of Engineering], [Chulalongkorn University]. I am the 2025 recipient of the [Ananda Mahidol Scholarship], a fully funded award supporting outstanding Thai students for graduate study abroad in eight fields: engineering, medicine, science, social sciences, arts and humanities, agriculture, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.

I am deeply passionate about aerospace propulsion, especially the integration of *turbomachinery* and *combustion*. My current interests focus on the development of supersonic gas turbine for rotating detonation engines, as well as rocket-engine turbopumps, and other high-speed turbomachinery applications.

### Current research interests
Advancing next-generation aerospace propulsion and power generation technology through innovative turbomachinery and combustion system.\
•	Supersonic gas turbine in Rotating Detonation Engine for propulsion and power generation\
•	Fuel injection in Rotating Detonation Engine\
•	Combustion of green fuels, i.e. hydrogen, ammonia

> The greatest invention of humanity is Science
