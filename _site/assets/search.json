This page contains information about my past and present, both works and interests.\n\n\n\nBriefly About Me\n\nMy name is Krai Naruepornmatee. I graduated with first-class honors in Mechanical Engineering from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University. I am the 2025 recipient of the Ananda Mahidol Scholarship, a fully funded award supporting outstanding Thai students for graduate study abroad in eight fields: engineering, medicine, science, social sciences, arts and humanities, agriculture, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.\n\nI am deeply passionate about aerospace propulsion, especially the integration of turbomachinery and combustion. My current interests focus on the development of supersonic gas turbine for rotating detonation engines, as well as rocket-engine turbopumps, and other high-speed turbomachinery applications.\n\nCurrent research interests\nAdvancing next-generation aerospace propulsion and power generation technology through innovative turbomachinery and combustion system.\n•\tSupersonic gas turbine in Rotating Detonation Engine for propulsion and power generation\n•\tFuel injection in Rotating Detonation Engine\n•\tCombustion of green fuels, i.e. hydrogen, ammonia\n\n\n  The greatest invention of humanity is Science\n\n\n",
